# Turn On an LED

The LEDs on the board are considered normal pins.

This way we can simply set the C7 pin to high `GPIOC->ODR |= GPIO_Pin_7;` to turn ON the blue LED, and `GPIOC->ODR &= ~GPIO_Pin_7;` to turn it OFF

The green LED is on pin E7: `GPIOE->ODR |= GPIO_Pin_7;`, `GPIOE->ODR &= ~GPIO_Pin_7;`
